# foundryvtt-api-guide
This Repository is intended to host various small guides to help getting started with the API of FoundryVTT. Unless otherwise noted the current main branch is for the current stable version of FoundryVTT though.

Presently the only guide hosted here is the [Beginners Macro Guide](https://github.com/GamerFlix/foundryvtt-api-guide/blob/main/macro_guide.md)
