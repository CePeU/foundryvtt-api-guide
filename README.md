# foundryvtt-api-guide
This Repository is intended to host various small guides to help getting started with the API of FoundryVTT. Unless otherwise noted the current main branch is for the current stable version of FoundryVTT though.

Presently finished guides hosted here include the [Beginners Macro Guide](https://github.com/GamerFlix/foundryvtt-api-guide/blob/main/macro_guide.md), [Guide to Advanced Foundry infrastructure](https://github.com/GamerFlix/foundryvtt-api-guide/blob/main/advanced_api_guide.md) and the [guide to scripts executed by Regions](https://github.com/GamerFlix/foundryvtt-api-guide/blob/main/region_macros_guide.md).
A guide to creating a Module and adding a script to it [also exists](https://github.com/GamerFlix/foundryvtt-api-guide/blob/main/module_guide_create.md) though writing the relevant code for this has not been adressed yet.

For an overview of numerous topics that is directed at more seasoned programmers see [here](https://mxzf.gitlab.io/foundry-info/). Note that it is still work in progress however.
